  **No dni** I rock with most people if you suck & i dont agree with you I just wont interact. I'm a huge believer in curating your own internet experience and thus hate when people get in2 pointless arguments with strangers. Remain cordial and mindful!

  I dont mind when people talk to me, actually i really like when people interact so my apologies if I come off as unapproachable I do appreciate it very much. C+h is welcomed! Obviously dnc or whatever but when i really think about it I dont care that much. It isnt an outlet ENCOURAGING people 2 copy me but hell, if someone cared so much 2 screenshot and colour my pixel horse i'd be pretty flattered!
