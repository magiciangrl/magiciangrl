  No dni I rock with most people if you suck / i dont agree with you / are a FREAK weirdo I just wont interact. I'm a huge believer in curating your own internet experience and thus hate when people get in2 pointless arguments with strangers. Remain cordial and mindful!

  I dont mind when people talk to me, actually i really like when people interact & my apologies if I come off as unapproachable I do appreciate it very much. C+h is welcomed! Obviously dnc or whatever but when i really think about it I dont care that much. It isnt an outlet ENCOURAGING people 2 copy me but hell, if someone cared so much 2 screenshot and recolour my pixel horse i'd be pretty flattered!
